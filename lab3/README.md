with two juniper routers, creating multiple bgp links between devices. + adding snmp community for both devices.

On nodes we can set basic device settings like device name and loopback interface.
On network we have settings for all devices (setting user & authentication atm).
On fabric we configure BGP, with ability to set asn numbers for devices & links between devices + network where ip address will be calculated later...
On services we can define SNMP community settings.

Tried to keep it as simple as possible. Easy to add other components.
