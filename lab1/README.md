For very simple environment, which only contains 2 unconfigured Junos devices. We get information from those 2 devices with getfacts.yml.  Now we can deploy some configure with configure.yml (Vagrant had these defaults, but I'm running vagrant on windows, so had to make other VM for ansible.
Raw modules can run "cat .history" etc... commands, but cant use commands like "show version", because need to give "cli" command first.
