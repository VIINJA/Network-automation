Wanted to gather Uptime data from Junos Devices. 
I'm using juniper.junos modules. With juniper_junos_command I'll run show system uptime, and then I'll use set_fact to set uptime fact for each host.
After that it is just testing different Ansible modules to get uptimes in separate and single file(s)
